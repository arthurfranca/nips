NIP-17
======

Event Metadata
---------------

`draft` `optional` `author:arthurfranca`

Relays may attach event metadata to requested events.

## Motivation

To save relay bandwidth while helping clients show event metadata estimates faster.

## Fields

All fields are optional and live inside an extra nip17 key.

Some fields only make sense for a subset of kinds.

New fields may be added to this NIP later.

### Returned Event Example

```js
{
  "kind": ..., // 1, 23, 0, ...
  ..., // regular keys
  "nip17": {
    "+": 8, // kind 7 "+" reaction count
    "-": 0, // kind 7 "-" reaction count
    "ü§ôÔ∏è": 10, // kind 7 specific emoji reaction count
    "followers": 500, // sent with kind 0
    "language": "en", // ISO 639-1 code of detected event.content language
    "relay": "wss://relay.url", // event found originally on this relay
    "replies": 10, // direct descendant kind 1 reply count
    "reposts": 20, // NIP-18 repost count
    "views": 900, // request count from different IPs, device ids or pubkeys
    "zaps": 7, // kind 9735 count
    "zap_amount": 10000, // kind 9735 millisats amount sum
  }
}
```
