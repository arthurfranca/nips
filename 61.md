Bunch of Events
---------------

An event with a `kind` in the range 40000 <= n < 50000 is one of a bunch of events
of the same kind, pubkey and `d` tag. Publishing an event with these same three fields
won't replace the previous one.

## Referencing

A bunch of events is referenced by a `b` tag.
It has the same format of an `a` tag
but references a bunch of events instead of a single one:

`["b", "<kind integer>:<32-bytes lowercase hex of a pubkey>:<d tag value>", "<recommended relay URL, optional>"]`

It may be used to reference an unbounded list of events, different from NIP-51 lists
which may have a limit on the number of items depending on relay's event size restrictions.

To reference one of the events, use a regular `e` tag.
Using an `a` tag will reference the last inserted event of the list.

## Deleting

Use a kind `5` event with an `e` tag to delete items from the bunch
or with an `a` tag to delete all of them.
