Unbounded List
--------------

An unbounded list is a group of events with the same pubkey and `n` (name) tag.
An event can have many `n` tags, thus being member of many unbounded lists.

An unbounded list itself is referenced by an `u` tag
or by an `nunb` [NIP-19](19.md) entity using [NIP-21](21.md) URI.

## Use Cases

Unbounded lists are an option to hold a big number of items. In contrast, NIP-51 lists
have a limit on the number of items depending on relay's event size restrictions.

In fact, an unbounded list can be made of different NIP-51 lists from the same author.

For example, the NIP-51 lists may be "Close Friends" and "Family" but all sharing the same `n` tag,
effectively making an unbounded list combining both sets of `p` tags.

## Referencing

An unbounded list is referenced by an `u` tag. It references a set of events instead of a single one:

`["u", "<32-bytes lowercase hex of a pubkey>:<n tag value>", "<recommended relay URL, optional>"]`

One may also use an `nunb` entity URI: `nostr:nunb1qqstn...794234d`.
