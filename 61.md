Unbounded lists
---------------

An unbounded list is a group of events within the `kind` range 40000 <= n < 50000, all
with same kind, pubkey and `d` tag. Publishing an event with these same three fields
won't replace the previous one. An unbounded list itself is referenced by an `u` tag.

## Referencing

An unbounded list is referenced by an `u` tag.
It has the same format of an `a` tag
but references a list of events instead of a single one:

`["u", "<kind integer>:<32-bytes lowercase hex of a pubkey>:<d tag value>", "<recommended relay URL, optional>"]`

It is different from NIP-51 lists because these can have a limit on the number of items depending on relay's event size restrictions.

To reference one of the events, use a regular `e` tag.
Using an `a` tag will reference the last inserted event of the list.

## Deleting

Use a kind `5` event with `e` tags to delete individual items from the bunch
or with an `a` tag to delete all of them, similar to deleting parameterized
replaceable events.
