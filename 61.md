Event Sets
----------

`draft` `optional`

An event set is represented by a group of events, not a single event.
Each event of a specific set has the same pubkey and `n` (set "n"ame) tag.

An event can have many `n` tags, thus being member of many event sets.
To remove an event from a set, remove the corresponding `n` tag from the event or
send a deletion event (`kind:5`).

## Referencing

An event set is referenced by an `s` tag. It
references many events from an author instead of a single one:

`["s", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<n-tag>", "<recommended-relay-URL, optional>"]`

One may also use an `nset` [NIP-19](19.md) entity through a [NIP-21](21.md) URI: `nostr:nset1qqstn...794234d`.

## How to add items to a set

There are two ways:

**1) Include a `n` tag (the set's name) in the event to be added itself:** Do this for events that the author is you.
For example, adding one of your long-form posts to a set named "a-set-name-example":

```js
{
  kind: 30023,
  tags: [
    ["d", "<random>"],
    ["n", "a-set-name-example"]
    // other tags
  ]
  // other fields
}
```

**2) Add a `n` tag to a "Set Item Reference" event that references the item to be added:**
Do this if the set includes events for which you aren't the author or for other things that aren't events.

The kind and `d` tag value will vary depending on the type of item being referenced.

For each type of item being referenced, there is a public "Set Item Reference" event kind and a private kind.
Both have the same structure and tags. The unique features of the private version will be explained later.

The `d` tag value is set to an item reference.
**Some** of the event kinds **require** a `k` tag set to the referenced item kind to help with filtering.
Other indexable tags may be added to further assist with filtering.

**Table of "Set Item Reference" Event Kinds and Structure by Referenced Item Type**:

| Type | Kind | Private Kind | d-tag | k-tag |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| **pubkey** | 30382 | 31382 | `<user-pubkey>` | |
| **event** | 30383 | 31383 | `<event-pubkey>:<event-id>` | `<event-kind>` |
| **(parameterized) replaceable event** | 30384 | 31384 | `<event-kind>:<event-pubkey>:<event-d-tag>` | `<event-kind>` |
| **hashtag** | 30385 | 31385 |  `<t-tag>` | |
| **url** | 30386 | 31386 | `<url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>` | |
| **word** | 30387 | 31387 | `<lowercase-string>` | |

These events may have tags other than `n` with extra metadata about the referenced item.
Because of that, when removing some metadata during an edit, clients should only delete the event when all tags other
than the `d` one were removed and the content is an empty string.

Example of 1 item (a pubkey) that is simultaneously part of 3 event sets:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "pubkey": "<me>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<another-user-pubkey>"],
    ["n", "follow"],
    ["n", "friend"],
    ["n", "Best Friends Forever"]
    // ...other metadata
  ],
  // ...empty string or secret metadata
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["petname", "Zygote"],
    ["summary", "Owes me a beer"],
    // ...other secret metadata
  ])),
  // ...other fields
}
```

**Private "Set Item Reference" Event:**

What makes such events private is the process of obfuscating the `d` tag value and adding the clear version of it
inside the encrypted `.content`.

To obfuscate a value, it is deterministically hashed by generating an auxiliary private key
with the [NIP-44](44.md) HKDF function and salt set to "nip61", concatenating it with the to-be-obfuscated value,
hashing the result with SHA256, then encoding it to hex.

Example event:

```js
{
  "kind": 31382,
  "pubkey": "<me>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", toHex(sha256(hkdf("<my-private-key>", salt: "nip61") || "<another-user-pubkey>"))]
    ["n", "example-set-name"]
  ],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["d", "<another-user-pubkey>"]
    // ...other secret metadata
  ])),
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Set Names

There are two types of sets: those with a "standard" name and those with a "custom" one (most likely user-generated name).

### Standard

Standard sets have one of the names (the `n` tag value) listed here to guarantee interoperability.
The convention is to prefer lowercase English words in singular form with dash separator.

| n-tag | description |
|-|-|
| bookmark | list of things a user wants to save |
| contact | pubkeys to whom the user sent DMs or started an interaction such as an one-on-one audio/video call |
| file | adds events and files (urls) to a root directory similar to "/" |
| follow | followed pubkeys, hashtags, etc |
| friend | friends' pubkeys |
| mute | pubkeys, hashtags, words or notes the user doesn't want to see in their feeds |

### Custom

To **keep track of the custom set names**, a "Custom Set" `kind:30061` event is published for each of them.
The `d` tag is the name. Example:

```js
{
  kind: 30061,
  tags: [
    ["d", "Good Fellows"]
  ]
  // other fields
}
```

**A custom set may be grouped in other sets to make them related by adding an `n` tag**.
The below example shows how clients can fetch `kind:30061` events with `n-tag=follow`
to discover custom follow-like set names:

```js
{
  kind: 30061,
  tags: [
    ["d", "Best Friends Forever"],
    ["n", "follow"]
  ]
  // other fields
}
```

**For names that are secret**, an encrypted `map` tag maps the obfuscated set name to its real name.
Creating a private directory name example:

```js
{
  kind: 30061,
  tags: [
    ["d", "14pqug65sgl"], // obfuscated set name (random and unique)
    ["n", "file"] // to hint to clients it is a directory-like custom set
    ["map", nip44Encrypt("/sub/directory")] // the real set name is encrypted
  ]
  // other fields
}
```
