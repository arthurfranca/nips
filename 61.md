Unbounded lists
---------------

An unbounded list is a group of events within the `kind` range `40000 <= n < 50000`, all
with same kind, pubkey and `d` tag. Publishing an event with these same three fields
won't replace the previous one. An unbounded list itself is referenced by an `s` tag
or by an `nset` [NIP-19](19.md) entity using [NIP-21](21.md) URI.

Unbounded lists are different from NIP-51 lists because these can have a limit on
the number of items depending on relay's event size restrictions.

## Referencing

An unbounded list is referenced by an `s` tag.
It references a set of events instead of a single one:

`["s", "<kind integer>:<d tag value>:<32-bytes lowercase hex of a pubkey>", "<recommended relay URL, optional>"]`

One may use an `nset` entity URI too: `nostr:nset1qqstn...`

To reference one of the events in the list, use a regular `e` tag, `nevent` or `note` entities.

## Deleting

Use a kind `5` event with `e` tags to delete individual items from the list
or with an `s` tag to delete all of them.
