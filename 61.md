Unbound List
--------------

`draft` `optional`

An unbound list is a group of events with the same pubkey and `n` (list "n"ame) tag.
An event can have many `n` tags, thus being member of many unbound lists.

To add an event to the "Close Friends" list,
add a "close-friend" (prefer lowercase English words in singular form with dash separator) `n` tag to the event.

To remove an event from a "Close Friends" list,
remove the "close-friend" `n` tag from the event.

An unbound list itself is referenced by an `u` tag
or by an `nlist` [NIP-19](19.md) entity using [NIP-21](21.md) URI.

## Use Cases


While unbound lists can have any number of items.

The downside of unbound lists is that migrating a list from one relay to another can be rate limited
due to saving many individual events during a small time window.

Public and encrypted data can coexist in unbound list events, similar to NIP-51 lists.

## Referencing

An unbound list is referenced by an `u` tag.
It references a set of events from an author instead of a single one:

`["u", "<32-bytes lowercase hex of a pubkey>:<n tag value>", "<recommended relay URL, optional>"]`

One may also use an `nlist` entity URI: `nostr:nlist1qqstn...794234d`.

## Event Kinds

The same `n` tag can be applied to any event no matter the `kind` or structure.
However, it is better to add `n` tag(s) to parameterized replaceable events, because
such events can be removed from a list later by removing the corresponding `n` tag,
due to their editable nature.

The following example is based on the unreleased
[Relationship Status](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/nips/blob/relationship-status/81.md) spec:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382, // This is a kind for public relationship info between the signer and another user
  "pubkey": "<me>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<another-user-pubkey>"],
    ["n", "follow"], // A "follow" "n" tag turns this event into a kind 3 equivalent entry
    ["n", "friend"], // He is part of may "Friends" list
    ["n", "close-friend"], // He is also part of my smaller "Close Friends" list
    ["n", "contact"], // My contacts are users to whom I've sent DMs or started an one-to-one audio/video call
    // ...other metadata describing the relationship
    ["T", "3:driver"] // This is using an unreleased spec to rate this user as a great driver
  ],
  "content": ""
  // ...other fields
}
```

In the above example, when removing someone from an unbound list (considering a `kind:30382` event),
a client should only delete the event when all tags other
than the `d` one were removed and the content is an empty string.

Above example's `T` tag comes from the [Trust Rank](https://github.com/arthurfranca/nips/blob/trust-rank/64.md)
unreleaed spec and it illustrates how unbound list entries can hold extra
data in contrast to NIP-51 list entries that are simple event id/address references.
